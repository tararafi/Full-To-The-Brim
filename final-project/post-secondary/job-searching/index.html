        <h1>Job Searching</h1>

        <p>Graduating from post secondary institutions in a time like this has placed many students in uncomfortable and worrying positions in relation to their life after school.

        <p>Read below for some tips and advice for searching for full time job opportunities.</p>

        <div class = "text-center">
            <img class = "image girl-laptop" src= "../../images/post-secondary/network.png" alt = "A man shaking hands with another individual over a desk."> 
        </div>

        <h2>Tips and Advice</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>1. Get comfortable networking online.</h4> Make use of online social media platforms to reach out to recruiters and hiring managers. One of the most used, is LinkedIn. Consider creating a profile and messaging current and former employees for advice (professionally of course!)</li>

            <li><h4>2. Work on your skills</h4> During this era of quarantine, spend your free time honing your craft and learning new tools for the job you desire! There’s a plethora of online workshops and classes that can teach you just about anything.</li>

            <li><h4>3. Stay in touch.</h4>If you end up with some leads and manage to get some interviews, regardless of if you move forward or not, be sure to stay in touch with the recruiter and interviewers for potential future opportunities.</li>
