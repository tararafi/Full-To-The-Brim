        <h3>Create a study space.</h3>
        <p>One of the first steps to study more effectively is to create a study space that encouraged your productivity. Make sure this space is clean and organized and strive to come here every time you need to study or have some work to be done.</p>

        <img class = "image notes" src= "../../images/healthy-study-habits/notes.png" alt="A woman writing in a notebook at her desk.">
        <div class = "spacer"></div>
        <h3 class = "notes-text">Make notes and review them regularly.</h3>
        <p>With the flexibility of online learning, it is easy to fall off track and miss lectures. Ensure you take notes for every lecture, and review them regularly at the end of each week. This will help you remember key points and keep you accountable.</p>
        
        <img class = "image planner" src= "../../images/healthy-study-habits/planner.png" alt="A yearly planner notebook on a white desk with a pen next to it.">
        <div class = "spacer"></div>
        <h3 class = "planner-text">Use a planner to keep track of deadlines.</h3>
        <p class = "planner-p">This is one of the most effective tools to incorporate in your student life, as it’s easy to lose track of important dates. Keep a planner, either physical or virtual, to input all important deadlines at the start of the semester.</p>
