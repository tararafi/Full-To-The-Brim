        <h1>Managing Online School</h1>

        <p>Whether you’re on campus or off, adjusting to online school can be a struggle for many. Many of us have been accustomed to in person learning for the majority of our lives, and have had interaction with peers, teachers and friends almost every day.</p>
        <p>If you feel you are someone currently exploring how to maneuver post secondary school online, know that you are not alone.</p>
        <p>Below are some general tips and advice on time management and how to stay motivated with virtual instruction to hopefully get you on your way to a more productive and healthy lifestyle.</p>

        <h3>Time Management</h3>
        <p>Time management is a skill many students struggle with, but online school has exasperated this issue due to the ease of accessibility to distractions when learning at home. Below are some tips to help improve your time management skills.</p>

        <div class = "text-center">
            <img class = "image girl-laptop" src= "../../images/post-secondary/journal.png" alt = "An open notebook with a calendar in it."> 
        </div>


        <ul>
            <li><h4>Create a schedule.</h4> Planning your days and even weeks in advance will help in reminding you what needs to be done, and by when. Creating study schedules leading up to exam seasons and tests will also ease some of the worry you may be experiencing and help you to stay on track.</li>

            <li><h4>Block out distractions.</h4> When studying or doing assignments, place your phone away from you, or even in a different room. This will prevent you from reaching for it and keep you focused.</li>

            <li><h4>Try out the Pomodoro technique.</h4>Focus on your work for 25 minutes, and take 5 minute breaks in between. There are websites that offer timers to keep you on track, like this one: <a href= "https://pomofocus.io/">https://pomofocus.io/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Staying Motivated</h3>

        <p>It’s a difficult time in the world now, and staying motivated to complete school work can be a challenge. Here are some tips to make sure you keep yourself accountable and stay driven to reach your potential in school.</p>

        <div class = "text-center">
            <img class = "image girl-laptop" src= "../../images/post-secondary/goals.png" alt = "A typewriter and paper that says 'Goals'."> 
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Remind yourself of the reasons why you are in school.</h4> Is there a specific career you want? Is post secondary education required for you to reach some of your long term goals? Acknowledge these reasons and move forward with a mindset of gratitude and determination.</li>

            <li><h4>Set realistic goals.</h4>Setting goals for yourself, both short and long term, can help keep you focused while online learning. Make sure they are realistic and attainable!</li>

            <li><h4>Aim for a balance.</h4>Be sure to have a balance between work and play. Overworking yourself, especially when isolated at home, can only drain you more and prevent you from working at your best. Take breaks in between working and make time for other activities, whether that be reading a book, watching a movie, or spending quality time with friends and family.</li>
        </ul>
