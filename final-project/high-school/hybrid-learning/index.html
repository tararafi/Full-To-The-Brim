        <h1>Hybrid Learning During COVID-19</h1>

        <p>Hybrid Learning has been introduced to several high schools across the country in hopes to minimize the infection rates of COVID-19. However, this new form of learning can be difficult to adjust to, particularly for young adolescents.</p>
        <p>Here are some ways to ensure you’re performing at your best and staying safe:</p>

        <h3>Keeping Yourself Healthy</h3>

        <div class = "text-center">
            <img class = "image girl-laptop" src= "../../images/high-school/sanitizer.png" alt = "Hands reaching out to get hand sanitizer."> 
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Practice safe distancing.</h4> Ensure to keep at a safe distance from others in the school, both peers and teachers.</li>

            <li><h4>Wear a mask.</h4>This is one of the most important guidelines when it comes to keeping yourself and other safe from the virus.</li>

            <li><h4>Carry hand sanitizer with you.</h4>When touching doors, using washrooms or sharing items in school, carrying hand sanitizer with you can prevent the spread of germs.</li>

            <li><h4>Stay home if you are sick.</h4>This should be self explanatory, make sure if you are exhibiting any symptoms of being ill, stay home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Combatting Social Isolation</h3>

        <div class = "text-center">
            <img class = "image girl-laptop" src= "../../images/high-school/game.png" alt = "A monopoly board and game piece."> 
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>Spend quality time with family.</h4> With parents working from home and students learning from home as well, there is more time for quality interaction with family. Set up a game night, or watch a movie with your family!</li>

            <li><h4>Take a break from the news.</h4>The news can be overwhelming and sometimes can disrupt our peace. Be sure to stay informed, but take breaks once in a while as needed to preserve your mental health.</li>

            <li><h4>Make use of online platforms to stay in touch with friends.</h4>Have virtual hangouts with friends through Skype or Zoom, and share pictures on social media of your daily life with close friends!</li>
        </ul>
